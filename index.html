                            <p>The Trent Mathematics &amp; Statistics Conference (formerly known as Trent Mathematical Sciences Research Symposium) is an annual conference hosted at Trent University. This year, the event will be taking place on Saturday, March 23rd, 2019 to Sunday, March 24th, 2019. This event is put on by students, for students! </p>
                            <p>This will be an exciting weekend filled with student presentations and talks from professors, and will provide an excellent opportunity for students to gain experience presenting a talk in a professional but laid-back atmosphere. It also gives students the chance to broaden their mathematical knowledge by hearing about some of the research that their peers have been working on. Attendees will be able to network with other Trent students, as well as professors and students from other universities. </p>
                            <p>Student talks will be 15 minutes long with 5 minutes afterwards for questions (20 minute slots).</p>

                    <h2>FINDING ACCOMODATION IF YOU ARE FROM OUT OF TOWN</h2>
                    <p>TMSC welcomes students and faculty from all over Canada and the world. If you would like to attend the conference and are from out of town, we may be able to help you find accommodation with a Trent student for free. If this is something you require, please email us as soon as possible at <a class="email-address" href="mailto:tmsc@trentu.ca">tmsc@trentu.ca</a> and we will do our best to find you somewhere to stay. If you would instead prefer to stay in a hotel, we recommend staying at the <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/peterborough/ypqca/hoteldetail">Holiday Inn</a> on George Street, since it is one bus ride away from Trent University.</p>
                    <h2>TRAVEL BURSARIES</h2>
                    <p>If you would like to attend but are from out of town, we may be able to cover some or all of your travel expenses. Priority will be given to students who are planning on presenting a talk or participating in the case study competition, and to students who are planning on traveling in a group / carpooling. If you are interested in attending TMSC 2019 and would like to be considered for a travel bursary, please email <a class="email-address" href="mailto:tmsc@trentu.ca">tmsc@trentu.ca</a> and provide us with the following information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your name and the name of anyone else who would be traveling with you</li>
                        <li>Your university or location that you would be traveling to Trent from</li>
                        <li>Your estimated travel costs (for you and for anyone else you may be traveling with)</li>
                        <li>Whether or not you (or anyone you are traveling with) plan on presenting a talk, and, if so, the content of your talk (1-2 sentences)</li>
                        <li>Whether or not you (or anyone you are traveling with) plan or participating in the case study competition</li>
                        <li>Any other additional information you would like us to take into consideration</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, if you are from out of town, you can request travel funding from external sources such as your Mathematics Department at your institution. Most universities have travel awards available for students to attend conferences and other career development opportunities. You can also check the <a href="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> section for more information on obtaining travel funding. If you are thinking of attending but are unsure about how to make that happen, please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> and we will do our best to help you attend!</p>
                    <h2>PRESENTING A TALK</h2>
                    <p>Students should aim for their talks to be 10-15 minutes in length. Each student speaker will have a 20 minute time-slot: 15 minutes for their talk, followed by 5 minutes for questions. </p>
                    <p>While many students will choose to present research (such as work they have completed for a USRA, Honours Project, or Community Research Project), talks are not restricted to research and students are welcome to present a talk on any Mathematical topic that interests them. For example, a student could give a talk on a logic problem, some history of Mathematics, a funny Mathematics-related story, or a tutorial on something Math-related. As long as the topic is pertinent to Mathematics or related fields, it will be taken into consideration. If you have an idea for a talk and are unsure about the topic, you can email us at <a class="email-address" href="mailto:tmsc@trentu.ca">tmsc@trentu.ca</a> and we can provide prompt feedback.</p>
                    <p>All students are encouraged to apply to give a talk at the conference by submitting an abstract. Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by the organizing committee in order to determine which talks will be accepted, and to determine which order the talks should go in, based on the content of the talk. Abstracts should be approximately 75-150 words and should provide a brief explanation of what your talk will be about. To read a sample abstract from last year's conference, please see the <a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> section.</p>
                    <p>In order to determine which talks will be accepted in a timely manner, you will be required to submit a draft of your abstract at the time that you register. This draft should give us a rough idea of your topic, but does not have to be perfect, as it can be revised later. The stronger your draft abstract is, the more likely your talk is to be accepted. Final abstracts will be included in the conference program, as well as the website (if you request it to be). If your talk is accepted, we will contact you by email to let you know the day and time that your talk has been scheduled for. At this point, you can revise your abstract if need be, and you can let us know if you would like to have your final copy of your talk title and abstract included on the website. For this reason, it is very important that you register using an email that you check regularly.</p>
                    <p>If you want to give a presentation but don't want to give a student talk, you should consider participating in the case study competition. </p>
                    <h2>PARTICIPATING IN THE CASE STUDY COMPETITION</h2>
                    <p>The case study competition will allow teams of 1-4 students to work together to apply their knowledge of Statistics and Data Visualization to a real world dataset. The case study will be very open-ended and teams will have the freedom to be creative with their analysis. While a background in statistics will be an asset, it is by no means required and all students are encouraged to participate in the case study competition.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of reasons why students are encouraged to participate in the case study competition. Students who participate will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have the opportunity to work with other students on a fun and educational project</li>
                        <li>Gain experience working with a large and interesting dataset</li>
                        <li>Put what you've learned in your classes into practice with real data</li>
                        <li>Add to your CV / resume</li>
                        <li>Gain experience with public speaking in a stress-free setting, in a way that is less intimidating than giving a student talk</li>
                        <li>Have the chance to win prizes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each team will be given the opportunity to give a 5 minute presentation using any media of their choice (e.g., poster, slideshow, etc.) to summarize their methods and findings. When determining prize winners, judges will consider a number of factors, such as creativity, analysis methods, and presentation of results. The competition is intended to be open-ended and teams are encouraged to take their analysis in whichever direction best complements the strengths of the team members.</p>
                    <p>Students are allowed to consult faculty members for advice and direction; however, faculty members cannot complete the analysis for the students.</p>
                    <p>Students of all education levels (undergraduate, graduate, PhD) are welcome to participate; however, the education level of the team members will be taken into consideration when determining prize winners.</p>
                    <p>Teams may be composed of students from different universities if desired.</p>
                    <p>Students may use any tools they wish, such as R or Python. Be sure to state any tools you used in your analysis when presenting your results.</p>

                                    <h3>Trent University, Peterborough</h3>
                                    <p>Trent University is known for having one of the most beautiful campuses in
                                    Canada. The Otonabee River runs directly through our campus, splitting it into two
                                    sections with a bridge connecting the West Bank and the East Bank. At Trent, you can
                                    see the Otonabee from virtually every building, including the Trent Student Centre, which
                                    is where the conference will be hosted. Trent’s campus is 1450
                                    acres and offers over 30km of hiking trails, so students will be able to enjoy the natural
                                    beauty of the Kawartha region while visiting Trent University.</p><br>
                                    <p> Our University is located
                                    approximately 15 minutes from downtown Peterborough, which offers live music,
                                    theatre, trendy cafes and pubs, and much more. The Peterborough area also has many
                                    activities for tourists, including the (free) Riverview Park and Zoo, the Canadian Canoe
                                    Museum, and the Warsaw Caves. Trent University is centrally located in Canada, just 90 minutes from Toronto,
                                    and is easily accessible to students from all provinces, with bus routes from many major
                                    cities travelling directly to Peterborough. </p>

                                        Typically, most universities have some funding set aside for students to attend conferences or other opportunities which allow
                                        for personal or professional development. For example, you can try to:</p>

                                        If you have completed a USRA or other research project, you should also consider asking your supervisor for assistance in obtaining travel funding, especially if you are planning on presenting the research you completed.

                                        Absolutely! The 2019 Trent Mathematics and Statistics Conference will provide a professional yet comfortable atmosphere for students
                                        to give a presentation. This is a great opportunity to gain experience with public speaking and add to your CV / resume. All students,
                                        regardless of how far along you are in your education, are encouraged to present. This can be by giving a talk or by
                                        participating in the case study competition.

                                        Our vision for this conference is to create an inclusive and supportive atmosphere for students to share and pursue their love of Mathematics.
                                        Students can present a talk on anything which is interesting to them, and does not have to be limited to research. For example, you could
                                        give a talk on a logic problem, some history of Mathematics, a funny Mathematics-related story, a tutorial on something Math-related,
                                        or anything you want! As long as the topic is
                                        related to Mathematics and appropriate, it will be taken into consideration. If you have an idea for a talk and are unsure about the topic,
                                        you can email us at <a class="links" href="mailto:tmsc@trentu.ca">tmsc@trentu.ca</a> and we can provide feedback.

                                        talk to be 10-15 minutes. When you are presenting, a student volunteer will let you know when you have reached the 10 minute, 14 minute, and 15
                                        minute marks, by holding up a coloured piece of paper. This will give you a rough idea of how much time you have used,
                                        so that you don't have to worry about watching a timer while you are presenting.

                                        An abstract provides a brief explanation of what your talk will be about. It will be included in the conference program, as well as the
                                        website (if you want). It should be approximately 75-150 words.
                                        The organizing committee will read submitted abstracts ahead of time in order to determine which talks will be accepted, and to determine
                                        which order the talks should go in, based on the content of the talk. The stronger your abstract is, the more likely your talk will be accepted!

                                        <p>The following is an example of an abstract from last year's conference, for a talk which received the "Oustanding Talk" Award.</p>
                                        <p><strong>From Simple Random Walks to Brownian Motion (and Beyond)</strong> </p>
                                        <p> How can we model randomly bouncing particles? What about stock prices, white noise, genetic evolution, and other continuously
                                        changing random things? It turns out that all of them can be described in some way by Brownian motion – a random walk that is continuous
                                        in both space and time. We are going to see how such an object can be constructed from simple, discrete random walks.
                                        We will also talk about some interesting properties of Brownian motion, as well as its applications and extensions.<br><br>

                                        You can participate in either one, or both (or choose to attend the conference without presenting). There are benefits to both options:
                                        If you choose to give a talk,
                                        it will be an excellent opportunity to gain experience giving a presentation by yourself. If you choose to participate in the case study,
                                        you will have the opportunity to work together with other students and present with your group. This will also be an invaluable learning experience,
                                        and will help prepare you for future statistical analyses.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed" href="#faq13">Do I have to have a background in Statistics to participate in the case study competition?<i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i></a>
                                    <div id="faq13" class="collapse" data-parent="#faq-list2">

                                        Definitely not! While having past experiences with statistical analyses will be useful for the case study, it is by no means required.
                                        The case study is an opportunity to work with other students on a fun and educational project, and there are no prerequisites for participating.
                                        The case study competition is designed to allow students to gain experience presenting at a conference in a setting which is less intimidating
                                        than giving a talk, and everyone is encouraged to participate!
